I'm thrilled to officially announce the launch of my new venture, Corespark. While on paper we're a technology company, my goal is for us to be something more: a dedicated partner for the small and medium-sized businesses that are the lifeblood of our home in the Yadkin Valley and Twin Counties.

Having lived and worked in this community, I've seen a persistent disconnect. On one side, we have incredible local entrepreneurs, craftspeople, and service providers who are experts in their fields. On the other, we have the ever-accelerating world of technology, which often feels complex, impersonal, and prohibitively expensive.

Local business owners know they *need* to keep up—with their website, with their processes, with a social media presence, with new tools like AI—but they're stuck. They're often forced to choose between faceless national vendors who don't understand our local market or overly complex solutions that feel like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

This is the gap Corespark was created to fill.

## **Our Mission**

Our entire business model is built around one core idea, which has become our company motto: to be your **"Trusted Local Technology Partner."**

What does that mean in practice?

It means we're not just another web design shop or IT service that simply sells you a product and walks away. Our primary goal is to act as your strategic advisor—a "Technology Architect" for your business.

We're here to help you navigate the digital world and find the *right-sized* solutions that drive *real, measurable business outcomes*.

## **Moving Beyond Websites to Business Outcomes**

For many businesses in our region, the first step might be a modern, professional website. But for many others, it's not.

Our process doesn't start with a quote. It starts with a conversation.

We want to understand your business, your frustrations, and your goals.

* Are you buried in paperwork and manual data entry?  
* Are you losing track of customer leads?  
* Is your current software holding you back?  
* Do you have a great idea for an internal tool but assume "custom software" is too expensive?

Only after we understand the *problem* can we architect a *solution*. Sometimes, that solution is a new website. But it might also be a small, affordable "micro-solution" to automate a single task. It might be a strategic plan to help you get more out of the tools you already pay for. Or it might be a consultation on how to safely and effectively use new AI tools to make your team more efficient.

## **Our Commitment to the Yadkin Valley and Twin Counties**

Corespark is my commitment to the local business community. My goal is to break the cycle of complexity and frustration and to provide the strategic guidance that has, until now, been out of reach for many SMBs.

We're here to build long-term relationships, to provide honest advice, and to help our local economy thrive in the digital age.

If you're a business owner in the Yadkin Valley or Twin Counties and feel like technology is a problem you have to *manage* instead of a tool you can *use*, let's talk.

I can't wait to get started!
